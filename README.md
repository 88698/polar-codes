Polar Codes encoding and decoding
=============================

The simulation codes of polar codes encoding and successive cancellation decoding are included.

To run the code for the block length N, suppose n = log2(N), 
please enter the following command
  * test_polar(n)

The frozen bits can be specified in the test bench.
